14)what is git fetch
->The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.

15)what is git remote 
->The git remote command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories.

16)what is git push
->The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository

17)what is git pull
->The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content

18)what is git rebase
->rebasing is changing the base of your branch from one commit to another making it appear as if you'd created your branch from a different commit.

19)what is git stash
->Git stash acts as a version control tool and lets developers work on other activities or switch branches in Git without having to discard or commit changes that aren't ready. Developers can simply stash the changes in their working directory and index state
